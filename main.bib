  abstract = {SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To inform surgeons about the practical
              issues to be considered for successful integration of virtual
              reality simulation into a surgical training program. The learning
              and practice of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) makes unique
              demands on surgical training programs. A decade ago Satava
              proposed virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation as a solution
              for this problem. Only recently have robust scientific studies
              supported that vision METHODS: A review of the surgical
              education, human-factor, and psychology literature to identify
              important factors which will impinge on the successful
              integration of VR training into a surgical training program.
              RESULTS: VR is more likely to be successful if it is
              systematically integrated into a well-thought-out education and
              training program which objectively assesses technical skills
              improvement proximate to the learning experience. Validated
              performance metrics should be relevant to the surgical task being
              trained but in general will require trainees to reach an
              objectively determined proficiency criterion, based on tightly
              defined metrics and perform at this level consistently. VR
              training is more likely to be successful if the training schedule
              takes place on an interval basis rather than massed into a short
              period of extensive practice. High-fidelity VR simulations will
              confer the greatest skills transfer to the in vivo surgical
              situation, but less expensive VR trainers will also lead to
              considerably improved skills generalizations. CONCLUSIONS: VR for
              improved performance of MIS is now a reality. However, VR is only
              a training tool that must be thoughtfully introduced into a
              surgical training curriculum for it to successfully improve
              surgical technical skills.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACTObjective: This study compared learning and skill transfer among university aviation students using interactive Augmented Reality (AR) technology versus traditional paper-based instruction. While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer.Background: AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases.Method: 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing times for task completion was used.Results: Learner task times using AR were consistently faster, replicating similar AR studies, compared to learners using paper-based. However, AR test subjects also took longer interacting with the technology, including gaming-style “play” and exploration of the digital twin AR flight deck environment. This is believed to enhance learner innovation, knowledge retention and transfer, warranting further study.Conclusion: AR users had significantly reduced task execution times. Pre-task “gamification and play” were also observed among the AR users, which could impact how educators and the industry assess and leverage learning strategies when using AR for job task training. }

  abstract       = {Soldier-based simulators have been attracting increased attention recently, with the aim of making complex military tactics more effective, such that soldiers are able to respond rapidly and logically to battlespace situations and the commander&rsquo;s decisions in the battlefield. Moreover, body area networks (BANs) can be applied to collect the training data in order to provide greater access to soldiers&rsquo; physical actions or postures as they occur in real routine training. Therefore, due to the limited physical space of training facilities, an efficient soldier-based training strategy is proposed that integrates a virtual reality (VR) simulation system with a BAN, which can capture body movements such as walking, running, shooting, and crouching in a virtual environment. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VR simulation system is able to provide complete and substantial information throughout the training process, including detection, estimation, and monitoring capabilities.},

Combining agriculture science with IT and VR, the virtual agriculture technology explored new ways of studying and applying agriculture information technology. On the basis of concept of virtual agriculture given, the composition, application range and development direction of virtual agriculture were analyzed. On basis of above mentioned, the architecture of virtual crops which is a typical application of virtual agriculture was analyzed and studied, and the model of virtual crops was modeled using plant three-dimensional rebuild technique. It can improve the applications of VR in agriculture fields and advance the process of agricultural modernization.},
